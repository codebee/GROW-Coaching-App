# GROW Coaching App Environment Variables

# Groq API (Recommended - Ultra Fast LLM Inference)
# Get your free API key from: https://console.groq.com/
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_api_key_here

# OpenAI API (Fallback option)
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key_here

# Note: You can use either one or both APIs
# - If both are configured, Groq will be used first (faster)
# - If Groq fails, it will fallback to OpenAI
# - If both fail, the app uses local offline coaching
